# Pathfinding_Visualizer_using-_Dijkstra
Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive web-based tool designed to help users visualize the process of pathfinding algorithms, specifically Dijkstra's Algorithm. This project leverages the power of modern web technologies to provide a clear and engaging representation of how Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between two points.
