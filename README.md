# Pathfinding_Visualizer_using-_Dijkstra
Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive web-based tool designed to help users visualize the process of pathfinding algorithms, specifically Dijkstra's Algorithm. This project leverages the power of modern web technologies to provide a clear and engaging representation of how Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between two points

HTML: Provides the structure of the web application, creating the fundamental layout and elements of the visualizer.
CSS: Styles the visual elements to ensure a visually appealing and intuitive user experience. It is used for grid layout, animations, and visual representation of the algorithm's progress.
JavaScript: Implements the core logic for Dijkstra's Algorithm, handling grid creation, user interactions, and real-time updates as the algorithm runs.
React: Manages the application's state and user interface components efficiently. React enables dynamic updates to the grid and the visualization of the algorithm's progression in real-time.

To run the project type "cd over to the project folder".
then type "npm start".
